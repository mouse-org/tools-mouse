## Courses
Mouse has designed several courses as recommended learning sequences for groups that want to focus on competency areas that complement one another thematically. Users can view the projects associated with each course by selecting the course’s tag in the [Project Finder](https://create.mouse.org/projects).

### Adding courses to a playlist:

After clicking on a course tag in the left sidebar, Educators will have the option to "Add Course to Playlist" by clicking a button in the top right of the course page. If the Educator adds the whole course to their group's playlist the projects will be added to the end of the playlist in the recommended order. Any projects that are already in the group’s playlist will be moved to correspond with the recommended order.

Each of the courses available on Mouse Create is listed below. Each of the projects in the course are listed below the course name and description in Mouse’s recommended order.
