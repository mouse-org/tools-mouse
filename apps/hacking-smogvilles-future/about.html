    <h2>About This Project</h2>

    <p>The community of Smogville is facing certain disaster in their future! Not only are they big time energy wasters, but all of their electricity is also made by burning fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas).</p>

    <p>They don’t realize that the more electricity they use, the more fuel their power plant will burn. And the more fuel the plant burns, the more greenhouse gas is put into the air. Pretty soon this will lead to frightening climate changes like rising water levels and bigger storms. They also don’t realize that fossil fuels are non-renewable, which means that they will eventually run out, causing electricity shortages.</p>

    <p>Good thing you’re here to help! This town’s future doesn’t have to be so terrible. YOU can save the day by helping the citizens make changes to their habits so they can avoid disaster!</p>
