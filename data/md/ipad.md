### Add the X-Ray Goggles Bookmarklet to your iPad:

These instructions will allow you to add the X-Ray Goggles bookmark to your iPad. The X-Ray Goggles work on an iPad but can be difficult to use because of the touch screen and because iOS Safari it is not as fast as a desktop browser.

We recommend using a desktop browser with X-Ray Goggles, but if you only have access to iPads the following steps will provide a workaround.
