*   The Notifications area is accessed through the lightning bolt button in the top navigation of Mouse Create.
*   If you have new notifications since the last time you clicked into the Notifications area, you will see a number in a red circle on the lightning bolt. This number clears when you click into the area.
*   You’ll receive notifications for many different events on Mouse Create (see below for a list).
*   The left side of the notification has the avatar image of the user who prompted the notification. If the speech box around the avatar is gray, the notification is from a student. If it is green, the notification is from an educator.
*   To view a notification, click it. This will mark the notification as “read” and it will turn light gray.
*   Click the “see only unread” link at the top to show just the notifications that you haven’t already clicked to view.
*   If a new notification comes in while you are in the Notifications area, refresh the page in your browser to view it, or click to a different area of the site and return.
