# Help: Accounts and Registration

## Account Registration

Mouse Create is currently only available to Mouse member sites. If you are not a Mouse Member [learn more about joining the Mouse learning network](https://mouse.org/join) on mouse.org.

### First, find your Educator Code

Each Mouse location (typically a school or other youth-serving organization) receives a unique Educator Code by email when they join or renew Mouse membership. For the protection of our students, adults will not be able to join Mouse Create without a valid Educator Code. This code upgrades your user and gives you special access to create a group for your students to join and to manage their work. Do NOT give the Educator Code to youth, but you should share the code with other adult educators at your location so they can lead projects with their students on Mouse Create.

If you are a Mouse member site, but have not received your site’s Educator Code, please email help@mouse.org with your name, and the name of your school or organization and we will get back to you ASAP.

### Creating an account: standard registration vs. joining with Google

Mouse Create allows educators and students to authenticate and link a Google Account (examples: Gmail and Google Suite for Education) to their Mouse Create account. When you choose to register using your Google account, each time you go to Mouse Create, you will be able to quickly login by verifying your Google account. You will not need to remember a separate username and password just for Mouse Create.

If you do not have a Google account, you can still register normally by choosing a username and password for Mouse Create.

### Troubleshooting Registration Issues

If you or your students are having trouble registering an account using the “Join with Google” option: 
1.  Make sure you have selected the correct Google account when prompted. 
2.  If you attempt to login to your Google account and the password is incorrect, you will need to reset your Google account’s password through Google’s services.  Mouse can not help you access your Google account.  
3. If you successfully logged into your Google account, and could not complete your Mouse account registration, check the information below first, then reach out to help@mouse.org with a detailed description of the issue including: What version of your browser are you using? What operating system are you using? At what point in the process are you receiving an error? Do any error messages appear? Share a screenshot of the problem if possible.

If you or your students are having difficulty registering your accounts or if the Register button doesn’t seem to work. Please go through these steps before reaching out to Mouse for support:

1.  Confirm that each field in the registration form has been completed correctly, and that there are no error messages.
2.  Confirm that the Terms of Service checkbox “Please mark that you have read and agree to the terms here" has been checked.
3.  Confirm that the “I am not a robot" Captcha is checked. Note: some users will be asked to complete an image quiz to confirm that they are not a spam-bot. This quiz can sometimes be difficult to complete. If it fails the first time, you will get a new quiz if you try again.

If there are no missing fields, the “I am not a robot" box has a green checkmark, and the registration form is still not submitting:

1.  Try using a different internet browser. Mouse Create works best in Google Chrome. Mouse Create does not support older versions of Internet Explorer or Firefox.
2.  Check that you are running the most updated version of your browser. If not, please upgrade.
3.  Run any pending updates for your Operating System.
4.  Check that you are connected to the internet correctly.

If you still can not create accounts, contact help@mouse.org. Please share these details about your circumstances: What version of your browser are you using? What operating system are you using? At what point in the process are you receiving an error? Do any error messages appear? Share a screenshot of the problem if possible.
